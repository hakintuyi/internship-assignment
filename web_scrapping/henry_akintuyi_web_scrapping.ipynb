      "next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it\n",
      "was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\n",
      "noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there\n",

      "the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand\n",
      "or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy\n",
      "<i>curtseying</i> as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you\n",
      "could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me\n",

      "began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\n",
      "way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do\n",
      "bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either\n",
      "question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she\n",
      "was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand\n",
      "with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the\n",
      "truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she\n",

      "looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,\n",
      "and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a\n",
      "moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear\n",
      "it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\n",
      "it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner,\n",
      "but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall,\n",

      "<p>\n",

      "<p>\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;\n",
      "there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first\n",
      "thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!\n",
      "either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it\n",
      "would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a\n",
      "low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about\n",
      "fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her\n",
      "great delight it fitted!\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",

      "loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and\n",
      "wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\n",
      "she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head\n",
      "would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little\n",
      "use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I\n",
      "think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many\n",

      "bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,)\n",

      "first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked\n",
      "‘<i>poison</i>’ or not”; for she had read several nice little\n",
      "histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and\n",

      "of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she\n",

      "dogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There\n",
      "is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little\n",
      "bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And\n",
      "it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg\n",
      "for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of\n",
      "them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s so\n",
      "useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats\n",
      "and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m\n",
      "afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\n",
      "from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it\n",
      "went.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n",
      "won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like\n",
      "them!” When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to\n",
      "her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a\n",
      "low trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell\n",

      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk\n",

      "for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the\n",
      "door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,\n",
      "as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the\n",

      "<p>\n",
      "“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when\n",

      "mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that\n",
      "rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you\n",
      "know, this sort of life! I do wonder what <i>can</i> have happened to me! When\n",
      "I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and\n",

      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\n",

      "<p>\n",
      "“A barrowful of <i>what?</i>” thought Alice; but she had not long\n",

      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little\n",
      "cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. “If\n",
      "I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\n",

      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began\n",
      "shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door,\n",
      "she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds\n",
      "waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up\n",
      "by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made\n",
      "a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could,\n",

      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged;\n",

      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it\n",
      "out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at\n",
      "once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to\n",
      "worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being\n",
      "run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another\n",
      "rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it;\n",
      "then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse,\n",
      "and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\n",
      "again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a\n",
      "very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its\n",
      "tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off\n",
      "at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the\n",

      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves:\n",
      "“I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\n",
      "I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how <i>is</i> it to be\n",

      "<p>\n",

      "flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like\n",
      "the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large\n",
      "mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had\n",
      "looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her\n",
      "that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom,\n",
      "and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was\n",
      "sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and\n",

      "“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more\n",

      "the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day about\n",

      "with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the\n",
      "truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she\n",
      "came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she\n",
      "looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,\n",
      "and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a\n",
      "moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear\n",
      "it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\n",
      "it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner,\n",
      "but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall,\n",
      "which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice\n",
      "had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she\n",
      "walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;\n",
      "there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first\n",
      "thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!\n",
      "either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it\n",
      "would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a\n",
      "low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about\n",
      "fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her\n",
      "great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much\n",
      "larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the\n",
      "loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and\n",
      "wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\n",
      "she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head\n",
      "would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little\n",
      "use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I\n",
      "think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many\n",
      "out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that\n",
      "very few things indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to\n",
      "the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book\n",
      "of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little\n",
      "bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,)\n",
      "and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK\n",
      "ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice\n",
      "was not going to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look\n",
      "first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked\n",
      "‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little\n",
      "histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and\n",
      "other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple\n",
      "rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn\n",
      "you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply\n",
      "with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink\n",
      "much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to\n",
      "disagree with you, sooner or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice\n",
      "ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of\n",
      "mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\n",
      "hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n",
